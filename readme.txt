1. Plan Your Website Structure
Homepage: Introduce your agency, highlight your services, and feature key projects or testimonials.
Services Page: Detail the specific services you offer (e.g., talent representation, idea development, consulting).
Portfolio Page: Showcase projects or success stories.
About Us Page: Share your agency's mission, values, and team members.
Contact Page: Provide a contact form, email, phone number, and social media links.

2. Set Up Your HTML Structure

Create individual HTML files for each page (e.g., index.html, services.html, portfolio.html).

3. Style with CSS
Define a clean, professional design with CSS.
Use CSS Flexbox or Grid for layout management.
Include responsive design to ensure it looks good on all devices (use media queries).
Choose a color scheme and typography that aligns with your brand's identity.

4. Add Interactivity with JavaScript
Use JavaScript for interactive elements, like a sliding image gallery or modal pop-ups for portfolio items.
Implement form validation on the contact page.
Use smooth scrolling or animated transitions to enhance the user experience.

5. Optimize for User Experience
Ensure quick load times by optimizing images and using efficient code.
Make navigation intuitive with clear menus and links.
Test the site on different browsers and devices for compatibility.

6. Deploy Your Website
Once completed, you can host your website on platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel for free.
